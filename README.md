# Initial Idea

Build a complete open-source logging utility in Python; which is flexible, 
extensible, and customizable.

Key features:

* add data
* remove data
* shift data
* plain text format

## Why do I need this?

Simply because DATA IS BEAUTIFUL.
Also, I like documenting/tracking/logging things.
